A local tourism agency in Bergen is launching a new website called ‘Holidaze’ for visitors to the area to be able to find hotels, B&Bs and guesthouses, and for the accommodation owners to receive enquiries.

## Description

The project required me to create a visitor side of the website where users can search accommodation and make enquiries, as well as the administration side where properties can be added and enquiries managed.

I created an API to store the data for the establishments, enquiries and contact submissions. I choose to use WordPress as a Headless CMS.

## Visitor site
- Homepage
- Search bar typeahead (auto dropdown with hotel names that match what has been typed)
- A results page with all hotels
- The hotel specific page which displays all details about the hotel
- An enquiry page either modal or separate page
- A contact page (different to enquiry page) which goes to the admin for Holidaze

## Admin section
- Create a login section that makes use of JWT tokens
- List of enquiries and new enquiries appear when user submits the form on the enquiry page
- List of messages from contact form
- The admin can create a new establishment
